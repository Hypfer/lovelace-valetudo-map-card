# Lovelace Valetudo Map Card

Draws the map from a Xiaomi vacuum cleaner, that is rooted and flashed with [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo), in a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) Lovelace card.

## Valetudo
Valetudo can be found on https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo. This is the only version of Valetudo we officially support.

This card requires at least Valetudo 2021.2.0.

If you want to use an older Valetudo version, check out the legacy branch of this project.

## Install

It is highly recommended to use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) for managing custom extensions of Home Assistant. It automatically manages the registration of additional resources required by custom cards and makes it easy to keep them up-to-date.

To install HACS follow their [installation instructions](https://hacs.xyz/docs/installation/prerequisites). There is no need to manually add this repository to HACS, just wait for the **Valetudo Map Card** to appear in the **Frontend** Page of the HACS interface in your Home Assistant instance.

## Configuration

When using HACS there is no need to manually make Home Assistant aware of custom javascript resources of this custom card. If you do need to check this manually, it is visible in the **Configuration** -> **Lovelace Dashboards** -> **Resources** tab.

On older versions you may need to add this to the lovelace configuration yaml manually.  
`lovelace.yaml`: Add custom Lovelace configuration in Home Assistant to enable valetudo-map-card JavaScript. Go to your HA overview, then right top "Configure UI", then right top again on the 3 dots and "Raw config editor".
```yaml
resources:
  - type: js
    url: /community_plugin/lovelace-valetudo-map-card/valetudo-map-card.js
```
### Home Assistant

`configuration.yaml`: Valetudo officially supports MQTT, with the preferred example configuration as follows. You will need to have MQTT configured in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/broker) and [Valetudo](https://hypfer.github.io/Valetudo/pages/integrations/home-assistant-integration.html).

When using the latest (2021.2.0++) version of Valetudo, you should see a new `camera.mqtt` entity which actually contains the map data.
Simply configure this card to use it and everything should be fine :)

### Lovelace custom card

Even when installing via HACS, the new card will **not** appear automatically in the list of card previews when hitting the "+" button on the UI. Instead, choose the "Manual" option and provide the following yaml content:

```yaml
type: 'custom:valetudo-map-card'
entity: camera.xiaomi_map
rotate: 0
crop:
  top: 0
  bottom: 0
  left: 0
  right: 0
min_height: 0
```

## Tips & Tricks
### Displaying as overlay
When combining this card with Home Assistant's `picture-elements`, you could use this to show your vacuum's position on top of your house. Make sure to set both `show_floor: false` and `background_color: transparent` in this card:

```
type: picture-elements
image: https://online.visual-paradigm.com/repository/images/e5728e49-09ce-4c95-b83c-482deee24386.png
elements:
  - type: 'custom:valetudo-map-card'
    entity: sensor.xiaomi_map
    show_floor: false
    background_color: transparent
```

Then use map_scale and crop to make it fit.
